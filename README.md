# N-Tier-Architecture-Generator
Create layered architecture project in asp core
This project will create layered arch in your project folder 
I created this becuse i work in a company with lot of medium projects and i like to use this type of arch in every prjects becuse its easy to maintain 
but with every new project i have to create folders,models and repositoies so i've decided that i will make simple project to create all this to me
Note* you will need to create asp core webApi project first and you have to give it models names 
i'am working on adding comments to the code(in my free times) so you canunderstand every line of code
